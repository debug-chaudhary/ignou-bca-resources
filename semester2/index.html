            <h3>Unit 1: Computer their Origin and Applications</h3>
            <h4>1.0 INTRODUCTION</h4>
            [span_0](start_span)<p>Perhaps Computer is the most powerful and versatile tool created by human beings[span_0](end_span). [span_1](start_span)In today's scenario, computer plays a major role in almost every aspect of life and influences our lives in one way or the other[span_1](end_span). [span_2](start_span)A computer accepts the input through various input devices, performs different operations on the input, and finally generates the resultant output through various output devices[span_2](end_span). [span_3](start_span)Hence, a computer is a data processing device[span_3](end_span).</p>
            
            <h4>1.2 ORIGIN OF COMPUTERS</h4>
            [span_4](start_span)<p>The origin of the computer is tied to the human effort to count large numbers[span_4](end_span). [span_5](start_span)This led to various systems of numeration, with the Indian system (0-9) being universally accepted and forming the basis of the modern decimal system[span_5](end_span).</p>
            
            <h5>1.2.1 Abacus</h5>
            [span_6](start_span)<p>Developed in China around 3000 B.C., the abacus may be considered the first computer[span_6](end_span). [span_7](start_span)[span_8](start_span)[span_9](start_span)It's a calculating board or counting frame used for arithmetic operations by manipulating beads on wires[span_7](end_span)[span_8](end_span)[span_9](end_span).</p>

            <h5>1.2.2 Napier's Bones</h5>
            [span_10](start_span)<p>In 1617 A.D., mathematician John Napier built a mechanical device for multiplication known as Napier's bones[span_10](end_span). [span_11](start_span)It consisted of a set of eleven rods made of bone or ivory that could be used to find products and quotients of large numbers[span_11](end_span).</p>

            <h5>1.2.3 Slide Rule</h5>
            [span_12](start_span)<p>Developed by English mathematician E. Gunter, the slide rule could perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division[span_12](end_span). [span_13](start_span)It works by sliding two rulers marked with logarithmic scales against each other[span_13](end_span).</p>

            <h5>1.2.4 Pascal's Calculator</h5>
            [span_14](start_span)<p>At the age of 19, French mathematician Blaise Pascal developed a machine capable of adding and subtracting numbers[span_14](end_span). [span_15](start_span)It was operated by dialing a series of wheels, gears, and cylinders[span_15](end_span).</p>
            
            <h5>1.2.6 Difference Engine</h5>
            [span_16](start_span)<p>English mathematics professor Charles Babbage started working on a 'Difference Engine' in the 1820s[span_16](end_span). [span_17](start_span)He realized that mathematical calculations could be broken into simple, repeated operations performed by an automatic machine[span_17](end_span). [span_18](start_span)He is often called the father of the computer[span_18](end_span).</p>

            <h5>1.2.7 The Analytical Engine</h5>
            [span_19](start_span)<p>Developed by Charles Babbage, the Analytical Engine marked a progression to general-purpose computation[span_19](end_span). [span_20](start_span)It had essential features of a modern computer, including a 'Store' (memory) and a 'Mill' (processor)[span_20](end_span). [span_21](start_span)It was capable of conditional branching, looping, and parallel processing[span_21](end_span).</p>
            
            <h4>1.3 COMPUTER GENERATIONS</h4>
            [span_22](start_span)[span_23](start_span)<p>The evolution of computers is divided into five distinct phases known as Generations of Computers, each distinguished by the type of switching circuits used[span_22](end_span)[span_23](end_span).</p>
            <ul>
                [span_24](start_span)<li><strong>First Generation (1940-1956):</strong> Characterized by the use of vacuum tubes[span_24](end_span). [span_25](start_span)These computers were bulky, required large rooms, and emitted significant heat[span_25](end_span). [span_26](start_span)The ENIAC was the first general-purpose programmable electronic computer[span_26](end_span).</li>
                [span_27](start_span)<li><strong>Second Generation (1956-1963):</strong> Based on transistors and magnetic core storage[span_27](end_span). [span_28](start_span)[span_29](start_span)Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, more powerful, and faster[span_28](end_span)[span_29](end_span). [span_30](start_span)High-level languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were introduced[span_30](end_span).</li>
                [span_31](start_span)<li><strong>Third Generation (1964-1971):</strong> Used Integrated Circuits (ICs), or chips, which placed miniaturized transistors on silicon[span_31](end_span). [span_32](start_span)This drastically increased speed and efficiency[span_32](end_span). [span_33](start_span)The development of minicomputers took place during this era[span_33](end_span).</li>
                [span_34](start_span)[span_35](start_span)<li><strong>Fourth Generation (1971-Present):</strong> Started with Large Scale Integration (LSI) and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits, leading to the microprocessor[span_34](end_span)[span_35](end_span). [span_36](start_span)This allowed for the creation of the personal computer (PC)[span_36](end_span).</li>
                [span_37](start_span)[span_38](start_span)<li><strong>Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond):</strong> Based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and parallel processing[span_37](end_span)[span_38](end_span).

            <h4>2.4 CONCEPT OF INSTRUCTION</h4>
            [span_62](start_span)<p>An instruction tells the processor what task to perform[span_62](end_span). [span_63](start_span)The set of all instructions a processor can execute is its instruction set[span_63](end_span). [span_64](start_span)An instruction is comprised of two parts: an <strong>opcode</strong> (the operation to be performed) and <strong>operands</strong> (the data)[span_64](end_span). [span_65](start_span)The execution of an instruction involves multiple cycles: Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Write back[span_65](end_span).</p>

            [span_96](start_span)<p>To balance speed, size, and cost, modern computers use a memory hierarchy[span_96](end_span). [span_97](start_span)This hierarchy includes fast but small CPU registers at the top, followed by cache memory, main memory, and finally large but slow secondary storage[span_97](end_span). [span_98](start_span)The overall goal is to achieve the highest possible access speed while minimizing the total cost of the memory system[span_98](end_span).</p>
